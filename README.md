# Simple Circular Progress Bar | V1

A minimal example of a **circular progress bar** built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This demo is focused on showcasing how to visually represent progress using a circular stroke and dynamic percentage updates — no external libraries, just clean and customizable code.
