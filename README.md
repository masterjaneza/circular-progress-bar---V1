# Simple Circular Progress Bar | V1

A minimal example of a **circular progress bar** built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This demo is focused on showcasing how to visually represent progress using a circular stroke and dynamic percentage updates — no external libraries, just clean and customizable code.

## 🔄 Live Behavior

- A circle fills up to represent a given percentage value.
- The percentage is also displayed as text in the center of the circle.
- Animated fill effect is smooth and can be controlled programmatically.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- ✅ **HTML** – structure for the circular container and progress display  
- 🎨 **CSS** – handles the circle shape, animations, and visual styles  
- 🔧 **JavaScript** – dynamically updates the percentage and stroke
